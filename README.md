# HatStream for Hackers - Secure Decentralized Chat App

<p align=center>
  HatStream is a decentralized chat application designed for ultimate privacy and security. Utilizing AES and RSA encryption, it ensures end-to-end protection, making data transmission unreadable over HTTP and also completely unreadable by ISPs. HatStream enables direct server-to-server (S2S) data transmission. With a web-based UI, users can securely access their chats from any device without needing a VPN.
